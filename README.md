# vArmor: A Cloud Native Container Sandbox

English | [简体中文](README.zh_CN.md)

## Introduction

**vArmor** is a cloud-native container sandbox system that enhances container security with Linux's LSM technology. It utilizes either AppArmor or BPF LSM as enforcers. It can be used to strengthen container isolation, reduce the kernel attack surface, and increase the difficulty and cost of container escape or lateral movement attacks. **vArmor** follows the Kubernetes Operator design pattern, allowing users to harden specific workloads by manipulating the CRD API. This approach enables sandboxing of containerized microservices from a perspective closely aligned with business needs. Particularly, **vArmor** includes multiple built-in rules that are ready to use out of the box.

You can leverage **vArmor** in the following scenarios to provide sandbox protection for containers within a Kubernetes cluster:
* In multi-tenant environments, hardware-virtualized container solutions cannot be employed due to factors such as cost and technical conditions.
* When there is a need to enhance the security of critical business containers, making it more difficult for attackers to escalate privileges, escape, or laterally move.
* When high-risk vulnerabilities are present, but immediate remediation is not possible due to the difficulty or lengthy process of patching. **vArmor** can be used to mitigate the risks (depending on the vulnerability type or exploitation vector) to block or increase the difficulty of exploitation.


**vArmor** achieves cloud-native container sandboxing through the following technologies:
* Leveraging Linux's AppArmor or BPF LSM to enforce mandatory access controls on container processes (files, programs, network egress, etc.).
* To minimize performance impact and increase usability, **vArmor** follows an Allow by Default security model, where only explicitly declared behaviors are blocked.
* You can enhance the security of containers in specific workloads by manipulating the CRD API ([Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)) using built-in and custom rules.
* The built-in rules include common strategies for hardening containers.

**vArmor** was created by the **Elkeid Team** of the endpoint security department at ByteDance. And the project is still in active development.


*Note: To meet stringent isolation requirements, it is advisable to give priority to utilizing hardware-virtualized containers (e.g., Kata Containers) for compute isolation, in conjunction with network isolation provided by CNI's NetworkPolicy.*

## The Built-in Rules

**vArmor** offers 5 types of [built-in rules](docs/built_in_rules.md#built-in-rules) and custom interfaces to meet various protection requirements.

| Type                      | Description              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Always Allow              | No restrictions are imposed on the container during startup, and the policy settings can be changed later, allowing dynamic adjustment of protection policies without the need to restart the workload.|
| Runtime Default           | Basic protection is provided using the default policies that are the same as the container runtime components, but the level of protection is relatively weak. (For example, [cri-containerd.apparmor.d](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/contrib/apparmor/template.go) in the containerd)|
| Hardening                 | The hardening rules for containers aims to reduce the attack surface and includes the following measures:<br>* Blocking common escape vectors for privileged containers<br>* Disabling specified capabilities<br>* Blocking exploitation vectors for certain kernel vulnerabilities.|
| Attack Protection         | The rules aims to protect against hacker penetration techniques, thereby increasing the difficulty and cost of attacks and enabling a defense-in-depth approach. It includes:<br>* Mitigating information leakage within containers<br>* Prohibiting the execution of sensitive actions<br>* Applying sandbox restrictions to specific executable files (AppArmor enforcer only)|
| Vulnerability Mitigation  | The rules is aimed at providing protection against vulnerabilities caused by insecure configurations, specific zero-day vulnerabilities, and security vulnerabilities caused by software features. It aims to block or increase the difficulty of vulnerability exploitation until the vulnerabilities are fixed.<br><br>(Note: This depends on the specific vulnerability type or exploit vector.)|


## Quick start

**For more configuration options and detailed instructions, please refer to the [usage instructions](docs/usage_instructions.md).**

### Step 1. Fetch chart
```
helm pull oci://elkeid-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com/varmor/varmor --version 0.5.4
```

### Step 2. Install
```
helm install varmor varmor-0.5.4.tgz \
    --namespace varmor --create-namespace \
    --set image.registry="elkeid-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com"
```

### Step 3. Try with this example
```
# Create a VarmorPolicy object to enable the AlwaysAllow mode sandbox for Deployments that match the .spec.target.selector
kubectl create -f test/demo/disable-shell/policy-init.yaml

# View the status of VarmorPolicy & ArmorProfile object
kubectl get VarmorPolicy -n demo
kubectl get ArmorProfile -n demo

# Create the target Deployment object
kubectl create -f test/demo/1/deploy.yaml

# Retrieve the Pod name of the target Deployment object
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get Pods -n demo -l app=demo-1 -o name)

# Execute a command in container c1 to read the secret token
kubectl exec -n demo $POD_NAME -c c1 -- cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token

# Update the VarmorPolicy object to prohibit the container c1 from reading the secret token.
kubectl apply -f test/demo/1/policy.yaml

# Execute a command in container c1 to read the secret token and verify that the reading behavior is prohibited.
kubectl exec -n demo $POD_NAME -c c1 -- cat /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token

# Delete the VarmorPolicy and Deployment objects
kubectl delete -f test/demo/disable-shell/policy-init.yaml
kubectl create -f test/demo/1/deploy.yaml
```

### Step 4. Uninstall
```
helm uninstall varmor -n varmor
```
